## Description

hello everyone, today we will do "Java Methods" and their applications.

## Activity_Tasks

Task 1: Greetings Method
Create a method named greetUser() that prints a greeting message.
Call this method at the start of your program.

Task 2: Basic Arithmetic Calculator
Create four methods:
-add(int a, int b)
-subtract(int a, int b)
-multiply(int a, int b)
-divide(double a, double b)
Each method should perform the respective arithmetic operation and return the result.
Ask the user for two numbers and display the results of each operation.

Task 3: Factorial Using a Method
Create a method named factorial(int n) that computes and returns the factorial of n.
-Call the method and display the result.

Task 4: Array Summation Method
Create a method named sumArray(int[] arr) that accepts an array and returns the sum of all its elements.
-Initialize an array with 5 numbers and display the sum.

Task 5: Prime Number Checker
Create a method named isPrime(int n) that returns true if n is prime and false otherwise.
-Ask the user for a number, call the method, and display the result.

## How_to_Use

Once the program starts, it follows a linear sequence of 5 Tasks. You cannot skip tasks; you must complete the input for one to move to the next.

Task 1: Greeting
Action: None.

Output: The program will print Hello, welcome to the Math program!.

Task 2: Basic Arithmetic
The program will ask for two integers to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Prompt: Enter two numbers / Type Here:

Input: Type an integer (e.g., 10) and press Enter.

Prompt: Type Here:

Input: Type a second integer (e.g., 5) and press Enter.

Result: The program displays the calculated results for all four operations.

Task 3: Factorial Calculation
Prompt: Enter a number for factorial:

Input: Type a small integer (e.g., 5) and press Enter.

Note: Factorials grow very fast. Entering a number larger than 12 may result in incorrect values due to integer limits.

Result: Displays the factorial (e.g., 5! = 120).

Task 4: Sum of Array
The program asks you to populate an array with 5 specific numbers, one by one.

Prompt: The Sum of Arrray... Enter the elements

Action: You will see Type here: appear 5 times.

Input: Type a number and press Enter for each prompt.

Result: After the 5th number, it calculates and prints the total sum.

Task 5: Prime Number Checker
Prompt: Prime number identifier... type Here:

Input: Type any integer to check if it is Prime.

Result: It will print if the number is "prime" or "not a prime".
