## Description

hello everyone, today we will do "Java Methods" and their applications.

## Activity_Tasks

Task 1: Greetings Method
Create a method named greetUser() that prints a greeting message.
Call this method at the start of your program.

Task 2: Basic Arithmetic Calculator
Create four methods:
-add(int a, int b)
-subtract(int a, int b)
-multiply(int a, int b)
-divide(double a, double b)
Each method should perform the respective arithmetic operation and return the result.
Ask the user for two numbers and display the results of each operation.

Task 3: Factorial Using a Method
Create a method named factorial(int n) that computes and returns the factorial of n.
-Call the method and display the result.

Task 4: Array Summation Method
Create a method named sumArray(int[] arr) that accepts an array and returns the sum of all its elements.
-Initialize an array with 5 numbers and display the sum.

Task 5: Prime Number Checker
Create a method named isPrime(int n) that returns true if n is prime and false otherwise.
-Ask the user for a number, call the method, and display the result.

## Sample_Output

(Task 1 greetings)
Hello, welcome to the Math program!

(Task 2 Basic Arithmetic Calculator)
Enter two numbers
Type Here: 16 <---(type any number)
Type Here: 8 <----(type any number)
Addition: 24 <----(16+8)
Subtraction: 8 <----(16-8)
Multiplication: 128 <----(16*8)
Division: 2 <----(16/8)

(Task 3  Factorial Using a Method)
Enter a number for factorial: 8 <---(type any number)
Factorial: 40320 <----(Displays the factorial of number 8)

(Task 4 Array Summation Method)
The Sum of Array
lets make 5 elements in array first <----(type the 5 elements in the array below as stated)
Enter the elements 
Type here: 21 <----(type the 1st element)
Type here: 22 <----(type the 2nd element)
Type here: 23 <----(type the 3rd element)
Type here: 24 <----(type the 4th element) 
Type here: 25 <----(type the 5th element)
Sum of array elements: 115 <----(displays the sum of element incoded)

(Task 5 Prime Number Checker)
Prime number identifier <----(identifies if the number incoded if prime number or not)
Now user pick any random number 
type Here: 5 <---(type any number)
The number 5 is a prime <----(Display)
